# Aspire

*Aspire* is a semi-yearly [beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping) [contest](/wiki/Contests) where the creators are encouraged to fully ignore the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria). The resulting beatmaps tend to be cosmetically appealing displays of absolute madness, but are often nearly impossible to play for average players.
