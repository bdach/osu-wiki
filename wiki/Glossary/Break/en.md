# Break

*Break* or **Break Time**, is a term used when a section of a [beatmap](/wiki/beatmaps) has no [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects). During this time, the drain in the health bar is temporarily halted. Breaks usually allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their input device.

Depending on the settings, when a break is initiated, letterboxes (the black horizontal bars on the top and bottom off the screen) may appear. In addition to this, a passing or failing graphic and sound will appear and play to indicate if the player is doing well or not, if there is enough time.

The use of break times in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania) maps is heavily discouraged.
