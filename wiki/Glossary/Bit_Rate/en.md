# Bit Rate

*For regulations surrounding bit rate, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

*Bit rate* describes the number of bits per second that can be transmitted along a digital network. Almost every music file contains something called a "bit rate". This means that a *higher bit rate* will generally mean *higher quality* (but bigger file size). Whereas, a *lower bit rate* will generally mean *lower quality* (but smaller file size).

Bit rates typically range from 96 KBps (kilobytes per second) to 320 KBps. You can usually check to see the audio file's bit rate by checking the file properties of that file. Another way to check is whether or not [AiMod](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/AiMod) says that the audio file's bit rate is too big. If either appears to be true, this means that you will have to lower the bit rate. A few methods on re-encoding audio can be found at [Audio Editing](/wiki/Guides/Audio_Editing).
