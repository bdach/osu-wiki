# Away from keyboard

*Away from keyboard* or **AFK**, is a term used when an active user walks off to do something else while they are still signed in. Bancho will mark users as "Idle" if they have been inactive for some time. Users may set custom AFK-messages with the IRC-client which automatically responds to any messages the user may receive.
