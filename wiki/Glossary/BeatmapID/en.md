# BeatmapID

*See also: [BeatmapSetID](/wiki/Glossary/BeatmapSetID)*

A *beatmapID* is a unique, incrementing number given to all uploaded difficulties of a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets). This number is shown on a beatmapset's beatmap listing page on the website. The beatmapSetID can be found in the url of a beatmapset on osu! web as the second set of numbers, or in the `.osu` difficulty file. Beatmaps will only be assigned a beatmapID once they've been submitted with the Beatmap Submission System.

All unsubmitted beatmaps will have a beatmapID of `0`.

You can use the beatmapID to find a specific difficulty of a beatmap by using the url: `osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/{BeatmapID}` or alternatively `osu.ppy.sh/b/{BeatmapID}`.
