# Authentic

*Authentic* is old slang for a beatmap that emulates a stage from the DS games in every aspect (song, settings, object placement, etc.). This term originates from a time where mapping was heavily inspired by the DS games. Nowadays, the term "authentic" has little meaning to mappers, as generations upon generations of mappers have been inspired by each other instead of the DS games.
