# Beat

A *beat* is a period of time that songs can be divided into based on their [BPM](/wiki/Beatmapping/Beats_per_minute). A correctly timed [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) will have each beat correspond to the song's rhythm, and a whole beat should fall between two white lines on the [timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines).
